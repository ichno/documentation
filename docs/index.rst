Ichno is a solution, provided as a Sass model, to facilitate tracking changes and the history storage of object instances or database entries.

You only need to send the instance of the object, with its current state, and the changes will be automatically detected and will be available for later searches.

It will provide the following features:

| **Track the changes easily**
| Centralized history logic. Save your team time and computational resources with history feature implementation.
| Lógica centralizada de histórico. Economize tempo da equipe técnica e de recursos computacionais com a implementação de funcionalidades de histórico.

| **Search for versions and changes**
| Through a simple interface, or an API to integrate, search for changes in instances of database records.
